This GitHub repository houses the codebase for a minimalist Unix shell crafted in C. The shell is engineered for portability and compatibility across diverse Unix-like operating systems. Offering a straightforward command-line interface, users can input commands, which the shell promptly executes. It encompasses fundamental Unix shell capabilities, such as running external commands, piping commands, and facilitating background command execution. The implementation also features built-in commands like "cd" for changing directories and "exit" for gracefully exiting the shell.

The source code is meticulously documented and compartmentalized into distinct files, each handling specific aspects of the shell's functionality. This modular organization aids in comprehending and maintaining the codebase, making it accessible for developers interested in understanding or contributing to the project.
